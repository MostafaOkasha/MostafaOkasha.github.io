# About Me

I was born in Egypt and moved to Saudi Arabia soon after. I recieved my honors high school diploma by completing the Cambridge IGCSE, and Edexcel AS and A2 curriculum. I then moved to Canada where I attended McMaster University

<aside class="post-aside">
  Since I lived in New Jersey while attending Regis, I commuted ninety minutes each way to school!

Before Brown, I was a student at Regis High School, a tuition-free instutition located in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. While I was there, I was the [Layout Editor of _The Owl_](/designs/the-owl), the [Lighting Designer][lighting-design] for the _Regis Repertory_, and one of the founding members of the school's Mock Trial team. I also was the Speech President of _The Hearn_, Regis's nationally-ranked speech and debate society, where I managed and coached a cohort of about sixty peers during weekly tournaments within New York and other events around the country.

In 2016, I was named on [CEWeek's _10Under20: Young Innovators To Watch_ list](https://younginnovatorstowatch.com/2016/08/03/zachary-espiritu-math-battle/) for my work on [_Math Battle_](/projects/math-battle), a game where players compete against each other in competitive online multiplayer math battles with a focus on increasing access to educational materials via technology.

As a result of _Math Battle_, I've been featured in the following publications:
- [The Star-Ledger](http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2016/07/espiritu_named_innovator_to_watch.html)
- [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robin-raskin/10-under-20-young-innovat_b_10842520.html)
- [CEWeek 2016](http://ceweekny.com/blog/2016/06/16/zachary-espiritu-math-battle/)
- [Filipino Reporter](http://www.filipinoreporter.us/home/filipino-american/3841-young-fil-am-wins-2015-congressional-district-app-challenge.html)
- [Hanover Eagle](http://www.newjerseyhills.com/hanover_eagle/news/article_808debd0-edfa-592b-92e0-93941026fded.html)

If I'm not doing anything Computer Science-related, you might find me judging at a local speech and debate tournament, improvising tunes on a piano, or in the theater working on sound or [lighting design][lighting-design].

# About This Site

Hosted on [Github Pages][github-pages], this site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator built in Ruby. I built the site's theme from scratch, and the source code for it (licensed under the MIT license) can be found at my Github repo [here][source-code].

For the automatically sorting "cards" seen on the front page, I use [Isotope][isotope].

If you've viewed some of the articles or project writeups, you'll notice that the images only load after the page has rendered. I'm using [Lazysizes][lazysizes] to lazily load the images in for faster response times.

Finally, in order to make sure all the necessary, visual-based Javascript is loaded before the page renders, I use [PleaseWait][please-wait] to display a brief interstitial with a humorous loading message until the page is ready to display.
