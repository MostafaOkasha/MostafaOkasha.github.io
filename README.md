This website was created in 2019 using an open-source Jekyll theme, which has been modified, adapted and incorporated with JQuery and Node.js for simplistic beauty.

This is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with a custom domain name (okasha.me) through NameCheap, SSL Certified through Cloudflare with custom global CDN hosting (overkill, I know).

## Installation Process

To get started with a similar theme or using Jekyll for Github Pages web hosting see the Jekyll Guide [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

```console
git clone https://github.com/MostafaOkasha/MostafaOkasha.github.io
cd MostafaOkasha.github.io
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can use <kbd>Option</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> to stop the server.

You might face a few issues with the Gemfile if you're trying to clone this website, what I recommend is to download any Jekyll layout/theme and manually move over all your static HTML/CSS code while following the appropriate Jekyll structure.
