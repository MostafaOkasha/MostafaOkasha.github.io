## My Personal Website.

This is the latest version of my website.
The base is an open-source Jekyll theme, which has been modified, adapted and incorporated with JQuery and Node.js for some simplistic beauty.

Check out the Jekyll installation page for more information on how to get started. You might face a few issues with the Gemfile if you're trying to clone this website, what I recommend is to download any Jekyll layout/theme and manually move over all your static HTML/CSS code while following the appropriate Jekyll structure.


Cheers!
